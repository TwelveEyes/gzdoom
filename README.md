If you want to try and get the game running on GZDoom, you're going to need to cherry-pick at least these several commits:

- https://github.com/HandsOfNecromancy/HandsOfNecromancy-Engine/commit/bb33cf9b9f0feca8ae364e7a96ee7125c6d08899
  - This commit is necessary in order to keep the game running smoothly. It keeps the linked light lists from being updated every tic.
- https://github.com/HandsOfNecromancy/HandsOfNecromancy-Engine/commit/0468fdade46e64018e4e2c94132ba78fb8616dbe
  - This commit is necessary in order to make the game look right. It allows rendering sprites under the ground.
- https://github.com/HandsOfNecromancy/HandsOfNecromancy-Engine/commit/83ad8ed5d5784458fe7c86fa54a4b980774ef8a3
  - This commit supports the skyward projectiles trick by not unnecessarily moving light positions for non-interacting objects
- ~~https://github.com/HandsOfNecromancy/HandsOfNecromancy-Engine/commit/55ce9f02e9d3ffc37539feb128b438d1f2039f8d~~
  - ~~This commit is necessary in order to do proper font displays for the actor label names~~
  - (note: the above was [recently merged into GZDoom](https://github.com/ZDoom/gzdoom/commit/3524d06813cd4841056901111bf649b023274255) but is not yet in an official release)
